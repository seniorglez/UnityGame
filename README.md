# Unity 2D SuperMario-like game

This is a simple game I build to learn the basics of Unity 2D

## Getting Started

If you want to get a copy of the project up and run it on your pc you only have to clone this repository using Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/seniorglez/UnityGame
```

If you prefer using ssh instead of http type

```
git clone git@github.com:seniorglez/UnityGame.git
```

Now you only have to open your local repository with the Unity Editor v.2019.1.9f1
